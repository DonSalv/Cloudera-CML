# Cloudera - CML

This repository has the Machine Learning Module of the Call Center project. It uses a Time Series approach to forecast the call volume and the hourly rates of incoming calls in a call center.

The data corresponds to call logs in the call center for callings received during one year in 2019. The reported time frame of calls is daily within minutes of precision

This repository is ready to clone in CML to explore the Machine Learning useage in the cloud using Cloudera Machine Learning
